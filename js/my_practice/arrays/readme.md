### Loop Methods

- JavaScript provides several built-in loop methods that can be used to iterate over arrays and other iterable objects. Some of the commonly used loop callBack methods are:

1. `forEach`: Executes a provided function once for each element in an array.
2. `map`: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in an array.
3. `filter`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass a certain condition defined by a provided function.
4. `reduce`: Applies a provided function to reduce an array to a single value by iterating over each element.
5. `for...of`: A loop statement introduced in ES6 that iterates over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
6. `for...in`: A loop statement used to iterate over the properties of an object. It enumerates the enumerable properties of an object, including inherited ones.

- These loop methods offer different ways to iterate over arrays and objects, providing flexibility and convenience in handling data. 
- Each method has its specific purpose, and you can choose the one that suits your needs based on what you want to accomplish in your code.

[Leetcode Problem 151, try it out](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)



The code defines a function reverseWords that takes a string s as input and reverses the order of words in the string. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

The string s is split into an array of words using the split(" ") method. The resulting array is stored in the variable splitString.
A stack is created using an empty array stack.
A for...of loop is used to iterate over each word in the splitString array.
Within the loop, each word is pushed onto the stack using the push() method.
After the loop, a new variable finalString is initialized as a space character " ".
A while loop is used to iterate as long as the stack is not empty (stack.length evaluates to true).
Inside the loop, the top element of the stack is removed and assigned to the current variable using the pop() method.
If the current value is truthy (not empty or null), a space character and the current value are concatenated to the finalString.
Finally, the finalString is returned after removing any leading or trailing spaces using the trim() method.
The code prints the reversed words of the input string "the sky is blue" by calling the reverseWords function and logging the result to the console.

- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. 
- It can be visualized as a stack of plates, where the last plate added is the first one to be removed. 
- 
- The stack has four main operations: 
  - `.push()` To add an element to the top.
  - `.pop()` To remove the top element.
  - `.peek()` To return the last element in the stack
  - `.isEmpty()` To check if the stack is empty

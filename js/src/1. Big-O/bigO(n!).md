## Explanation of the Code bigO(n!) 

- The generatePermutations function generates all possible permutations of an array. It uses a recursive approach, where it iterates over the array and generates permutations by selecting one element at a time and recursively permuting the remaining elements.

- The time complexity of this function is O(n!), as the number of permutations grows factorially with the size of the input array. As a result, the function becomes extremely slow and inefficient as the input size increases.

- It's important to note that O(n!) time complexity is highly inefficient and should be avoided for large input sizes whenever possible.


## Explanation of the Updated Code.
- In this updated implementation, we use backtracking to generate permutations. The function permute takes an array and the starting index as parameters. It swaps elements at different positions and recursively generates permutations by fixing each element at the starting index.

- By swapping elements and restoring the original order, we ensure that each permutation is generated only once. This eliminates unnecessary duplicate permutations and reduces the time complexity.

- The optimized algorithm has a time complexity of O(n!), but it performs better in practice compared to a naive implementation. However, it's important to note that generating all permutations still requires a significant amount of computation, so the function's performance may degrade for large input sizes.
